#  The Elven Minstrel Set List Plug-In 
I did this just because I could and, I figured seeing the scoped view of possible draws might help.  
Well maybe a bit.  Ok, well O.K. at least I don't think it will hurt my game.

## What it Does
When you mouse over the Elven Minstrel, a window fades into view showing the possible minions left to draw.
Yes, I know that this data is already displayed in the main UI, but I just wanted to see it filtered.
